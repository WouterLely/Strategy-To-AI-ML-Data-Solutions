# 🪄 Clustering Applications in a Fast-Moving Environment

## 🎯 The Challenge: Fast-Changing Dimensions!

In a digital landscape of **250+ applications**, things change — fast:  
- 📈 Some applications grow rapidly in size and cost.  
- 📉 Others shrink or vanish entirely.  
- ⚡ New applications are built overnight.  
- 🗑️ Old ones get retired just as quickly.  
- 🔄 And sometimes, the **purpose of an application changes** over time.

Managing this environment is like chasing shadows.  
To reduce **maintenance overhead**, keep track of **shifts in behavior**, and focus on **what really matters**, we apply **clustering**. 

Clustering helps us:
- Group similar applications together (based on cost size or usage patterns).
- Detect when an application no longer fits its "tribe" (a signal of change).
- Reduce noise and complexity across hundreds of moving parts.
- Periodically evaluate 1 model instead of 250 dimensions. 
- Provide **reusability** and a **clearer lens** for benchmarks, analysis, governance, monitoring, and optimization.

Complexity isn’t the enemy — **unmanaged complexity is**.  
Clustering turns chaos into patterns we can deliver with more analytical precision.

## ✨ What We Have Done:

This story is in essence an overview of what we have done for the **clustering engine** — a mix of **dummy data generation**, **data transformations**, and **clustering analysis**.  
It’s not about production-ready code or IP, but about frameworks, examples, and storytelling.  

#### 📊 **Clustering**  
  - Experiments with **clustering methods** (DBSCAN, KMeans, HDBSCAN, etc.).  
  - **Silhouette Analysis** helps choose the optimal number of clusters by analyzing cluster cohesion & separation.  
  - Total Cost Clustering → groups applications by size and spend.  
  - Usage Pattern Clustering → groups applications by service usage profile based on normalized data.  
  - The combination of clustering on Total Cost and Usage Pattern gives us the opportunity...  

🗂 **Output**  
  - One single table that gives an overview of applications and their clusters.  
  - Top 3 services (normalized) that define each cluster for insights.  
  - Materialized and reusable table for further analysis.

## 🧭 Why This Matters

In an ecosystem of 250+ fast-moving dimensions:  
- It’s impossible to manually track growth, shrinkage, and change.  
- Costs can spiral if patterns aren’t recognized early.  
- Governance frameworks collapse under the weight of unmanaged complexity.  

By applying clustering:  
- We **reduce monitoring effort** (1 script, not 250+ apps individually).  
- We **simplify communication** across technical and business teams.  
- We gain new grouping insights!  

Clustering is the compass in a world where the map changes frequently.  
It doesn’t give an exact or final answer — but it reveals the patterns that matter.

## 🚀 Possible Next Steps

- Expand clustering to include **time-series behavior** (not just snapshots).  
- Track **application migration between clusters** over time (signals of change).  
- Link cluster insights to **cost optimization** and **governance rituals**.  

🪄 *Clustering turns a sea of changing dimensions into a manageable constellation of patterns. That’s the essence of simplicity.*

This is **not production-ready code**.  
It’s a **storytelling & strategy-to-solution framework** showing how clustering can be applied in a fast-changing environment.
