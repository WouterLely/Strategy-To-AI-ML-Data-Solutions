# 🪄 The €1.8 Million Spell

## 🎯 The Challenge: Save Money!

Once upon a time, **a top 5 largest company in the Netherlands**:
- 40,000 employees  
- 500 people in the IT department  
- 190 people who needed to be informed  
- 878 AWS realms  
- 211 AWS magical artifacts (services) in use  
- 350 teams
- 250 enchanted applications  
- 5 environments

The total number of possible combinations of spells, potions, and incantations?
**70,662,844,000,000,000** or better said: seventy-trillion-six-hundred-ixty-two-billion-eight-hundred-forty-four-million
— a number so large, even the wisest people blinked twice.

After a careful examination by the **Cloud Cost Champion Experts**, it was revealed that there could potentially avoid or saved **a minimum of €12.5 million within the next five years**.

### 🔮 The Magic Trick: Focus on Impact and What Matters

Legends say: *80% of the impact comes from 20% of the elements* ([Pareto principle](https://www.scribd.com/doc/48948466/Elyahu-Goldratt-Theory-of-Constraints?utm_source=chatgpt.com#content=query:pareto,pageNum=122,indexOnPage:0,bestMatch:false)), but when the elements depend on each other, things get tricky and it becomes worse ([Science of Business](https://www.scienceofbusiness.com/991-rule-vs-8020-rule/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Here’s what we discovered:
- **85–90% of the potential savings** came from just **9 mystical AWS services** across **250 applications**
- Managing a **maximum of 4 parameters per application** reduced the complexity and summarize it in 9 graphs

All activities centralized around the question: _“What could or should we do?”_

✨ That’s the essence of simplicity.

### 🪄 What we have done

For these 9 enchanted services, we conjured:
- Strategic enchantments & organizational spells
- Documentation to provide answers and tech-solutions
- Governance and evaluation
- Shifting slightly toward less time-consuming and less complex form of [cooperation](https://now-to-new.com/tell-sell-test-consult-co-create-model/)
- A dashboard monitoring ritual that took **just 5 minutes per week with answers**

Result: no full-scale governance bureaucracy needed. **Impact achieved, magic proven.** 👏

### 💰 The Last Treasure

85–90% done of €12.5M = **€1.25–1.8 million** left to discover.
The challenge was to save money — and that worked. 💫

So do we celebrate success and stop, or spend some time to find the last €1.25–1.8 million?

### 📊 Detect & Visualize

Too little value to set up an entire management cycle, but definitely worth an analysis. Here, **anomaly detection** serves as our wand:
- Detect changes in cost
- Visualize anomalies that were detected
- Transform mountains of complexity into actionable insights

This repository is the spellbook: **stories, frameworks, and magic** showing how strategy transforms into AI/ML solutions that actually deliver.

**Moral of the story:**  
> Complexity isn’t the enemy — unmanaged complexity is.  
> With the right spells, you can turn complexity into simplicity and actual deliver… and millions saved. 🪄

*This story is real. The numbers approximate reality. The code and visualizations are simplified.*
